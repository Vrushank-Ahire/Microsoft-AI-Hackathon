# Microsoft-AI-Hackathon
From June 8th to 17th, 2024, our team participated in Microsoft's AI Hackathon, developing a Fake News Detection System. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the BERT transformer model, we identified and flagged misleading news articles. Our goal was to combat misinformation and enhance digital reliability.
